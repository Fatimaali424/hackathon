# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action to create intelligent robotic systems capable of understanding and responding to human commands in real-world environments.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement VLA models for robotic tasks
- Process natural language commands for robotic action
- Integrate vision and language processing
- Design human-robot interaction systems
- Create end-to-end trainable robotic systems

## Topics Covered

- Vision-Language-Action models and architectures
- Natural language processing for robotics
- Multimodal perception and reasoning
- Task planning from natural language commands
- Human-robot interaction and communication
- End-to-end learning for VLA systems

## Weekly Alignment

This module corresponds to Weeks 10-12 of the 13-week roadmap.
