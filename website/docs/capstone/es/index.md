## 📋 Project Overview**Duration**: Week 13 | **Prerequisites**: All modules | **Difficulty**: Expert

</div>

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the modules into a comprehensive Autonomous Humanoid robot system capable of receiving voice commands and executing complex tasks involving planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this capstone project, you will be able to:
- Integrate concepts from all four modules cohesively
- Design end-to-end Robotic Systems
- Implement voice command processing and execution
- Navigate and manipulate in real-world environments
- Evaluate and optimize complex Robotic Systems

## 🎯 Project Requirements
The system must:
- Accept natural language voice commands
- Plan multi-step tasks combining navigation and manipulation
- Navigate safely in dynamic environments
- Recognize and interact with objects in the environment
- Execute manipulation tasks with precision
- Integrate all four modules' concepts effectively

## 🔄 System Flow
### Voice Command → Planning → Navigation → Perception → Manipulation
1. **Voice Command**: System receives natural language commands from users
2. **Planning**: Task planning and Motion Planning for complex multi-step operations
3. **Navigation**: Autonomous navigation to target locations while avoiding obstacles
4. **Perception**: Object recognition, scene understanding, and state estimation
5. **Manipulation**: Physical interaction with objects to complete requested tasks

## 📊 Success Criteria
- Successfully interpret and execute 90% of voice commands within scope
- Navigate to target locations with 95% success rate
- Manipulate objects with 85% success rate
- Complete end-to-end tasks in less than 5 minutes on average
- System demonstrates robustness to environmental variations
