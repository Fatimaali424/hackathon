# Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the modules into a comprehensive autonomous humanoid robot system capable of receiving voice commands and executing complex tasks involving planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this capstone project, you will be able to:
- Integrate concepts from all four modules cohesively
- Design end-to-end robotic systems
- Implement voice command processing and execution
- Navigate and manipulate in real-world environments
- Evaluate and optimize complex robotic systems

## Capstone Requirements

The system must:
- Accept natural language voice commands
- Plan multi-step tasks combining navigation and manipulation
- Navigate safely in dynamic environments
- Recognize and interact with objects in the environment
- Execute manipulation tasks with precision
- Integrate all four modules' concepts effectively

## Voice Command → Planning → Navigation → Perception → Manipulation Flow

1. **Voice Command**: System receives natural language commands from users
2. **Planning**: Task planning and motion planning for complex multi-step operations
3. **Navigation**: Autonomous navigation to target locations while avoiding obstacles
4. **Perception**: Object recognition, scene understanding, and state estimation
5. **Manipulation**: Physical interaction with objects to complete requested tasks

## Success Criteria

- Successfully interpret and execute 90% of voice commands within scope
- Navigate to target locations with 95% success rate
- Manipulate objects with 85% success rate
- Complete end-to-end tasks in less than 5 minutes on average
- System demonstrates robustness to environmental variations

## Weekly Alignment

This capstone project corresponds to Week 13 of the 13-week roadmap.
