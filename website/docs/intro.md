# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics** - an in-depth exploration of embodied intelligence where artificial intelligence meets the physical world through advanced robotic systems.

## About This Book

This book provides a complete curriculum for understanding and implementing humanoid robotics systems. We'll explore how intelligence emerges through interaction with the real world, enabling robots to understand and navigate complex environments. Through a structured module-based approach, you'll learn the fundamental principles and practical implementations of humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

- **Embodied Intelligence**: How AI systems interact with and learn from physical environments
- **Humanoid Robot Design**: Principles of creating robots with human-like form and function
- **Control Systems**: Advanced algorithms for balance, locomotion, and manipulation
- **Perception**: How robots sense and interpret their surroundings
- **Real-World Applications**: Practical implementations in assistive care, industry, and research

## Structure of This Book

This book is organized into progressive modules, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Foundation for robot communication
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Simulation and testing environments
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - AI and control systems
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Advanced perception and interaction
- **Capstone**: The Autonomous Humanoid - Integration of all concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational knowledge needed for advanced humanoid robotics. Each module includes theoretical concepts, practical labs, and assignments to reinforce your learning.
