# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module covers the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) as the foundational communication and coordination framework for robotic applications. Students learn about nodes, topics, services, actions, and the distributed computing model that enables complex robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Design and implement ROS 2 nodes
- Create custom message and service types
- Configure and launch complex robotic systems
- Debug and monitor ROS 2 communications
- Implement distributed robotic applications

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 architecture and middleware
- Node communication patterns (publish/subscribe, services, actions)
- Message and service definitions
- Parameter management and configuration
- Launch files and system composition
- Real-time considerations and Quality of Service (QoS)

## Weekly Alignment

This module corresponds to Weeks 1-3 of the 13-week roadmap.
