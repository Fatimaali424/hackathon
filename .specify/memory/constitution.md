# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### High Accuracy and Verifiable Sources
All content must be factually accurate through reliable, verifiable sources. All factual statements must reference credible sources with official documentation preferred. Minimum 40% of technical references must come from official documentation (Docusaurus, GitHub, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, etc.).

### Clear and Structured Writing
Content must be suitable for beginners and intermediate learners (front-end & AI students) with writing level target of Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8–10 (clear, easy to understand). Use simple citation format with inline links or APA style where applicable.

### Technical Reproducibility
All instructions must be testable in real environments. Code examples must run without modification. Consistency with modern documentation standards (Docusaurus best practices) required.

### Transparency and Traceability
All generated content must be traceable to prompts, specs, and version-controlled edits. This ensures accountability and reproducibility of the content creation process.

### Zero Plagiarism Policy
All content must be original with plagiarism at 0% before final publication. Content must be created through proper attribution and original synthesis of sources.

### Consistency with Documentation Standards
All content must maintain consistency with modern documentation standards, particularly Docusaurus best practices, and follow established patterns for structure and presentation.

## Additional Technical Constraints

Technology stack requirements include Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code. All code examples must be validated to run in real environments before inclusion.

## Development Workflow

Content development must follow Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology using specs/<feature>/spec.md for requirements, specs/<feature>/plan.md for architecture decisions, and specs/<feature>/tasks.md for testable tasks with cases.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation and development practices. All contributions must verify compliance with these principles. Amendments require proper documentation and approval through the established process.
