# AI / Spec-Driven Book Creation using Spec-Kit Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through Primary Source Verification
All factual statements must be verified against original, authoritative sources. Secondary summaries may be used only when primary sources are unavailable and must be clearly identified.

### Clarity for an Academic Audience
Target audience has a computer science or technical background. Explanations must be precise, unambiguous, and technically sound. Avoid unnecessary simplification that reduces technical correctness.

### Reproducibility & Traceability
Every claim must be traceable to a cited source. Readers must be able to independently verify claims using the provided references.

### Academic Rigor
Preference is given to peer-reviewed research, standards documents, and official technical documentation. Informal sources (blogs, opinion articles) may only supplement—not replace—rigorous sources.

### Factual Verification and Citation Standards
100% of factual claims must be supported by citations. No uncited technical, historical, or statistical claims are allowed. Citation style: APA. In-text citations and reference list are mandatory. Citations must be embedded directly within the content.

### Zero Tolerance Plagiarism and Source Quality
Zero tolerance for plagiarism. All content must be original or properly quoted and cited. Plagiarism checks must return 0% similarity (excluding references). Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed (journals, conference papers). Remaining sources may include: Official specifications, Standards bodies (IEEE, ISO, W3C), Reputable institutional publications.

## Project Constraints and Tooling Requirements
Total Word Count: 5,000 – 7,000 words. Minimum Sources: 15. Output Format: Primary: Docusaurus site, Exportable: PDF with embedded citations. Tooling Constraints: Spec-Kit Plus governs structure and validation, Claude Code used for assisted authoring, Version control via GitHub.

## Success Criteria and Enforcement
The project is considered complete only when all of the following are met: Verification: All claims are validated against cited sources. Fact-checking review passes without unresolved issues. Integrity: Zero plagiarism detected. Proper attribution for all external ideas and quotations. Compliance: Fully adheres to Spec-Kit Plus workflow and structure. Meets all constraints defined in this constitution. Deployment: Successfully published using Docusaurus. Deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages. Enforcement: Any content, plan, or implementation decisions must comply with this constitution throughout the project lifecycle. The book will be written using Spec-Kit Plus, authored with Claude Code, structured in Docusaurus, and deployed to GitHub Pages.
